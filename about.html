            <p>Asslam-o-Alaikum</p>

            <p>Who of you will lend Allah a goodly loan which He will return after multiplying it for him manifold?(Surah
                Baqara,Verse 245)</p>
        <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give
            Qarz-e-Hasana because it is Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad
            prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way. He says, Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your
            wealth. If you do so, no fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be
            endowed with your wealth when you most need it. He further says that the poor and weak will not remain
            hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money
            on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He
            will also punish them accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not
            help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed
            the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot
            about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say: "I swear on my respect and glory! I will
            bring you closer to me and push them further away."</p>
            
            <p>Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by sending those people our way who
                follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other donations
                to help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only spread
                this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till
                the Day of Judgment.</p>
